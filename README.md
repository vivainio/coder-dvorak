# coder-dvorak

This is a modified version of Dvorak layout modified based on following requirements:

- ASCII letters (A-Z) are in same place as standard Dvorak for skill portability

- Numbers are rarely needed. Press AltGr + number key to type a number (except for 1, 2 and 0, which are immediately available)

- You can type scandinavian letters Ä and Ö from keys 4 and 5. To get the numbers, use AltGr + number

- Number row is: "12#äö\*()0{}" and shifted "!@$ÄÖ^&*))[]" (yes, it was orginally optimized for C++ programming but is at home with C#, JS and other old style languages).

Installation: use Setup.exe on windows or xmodmap on Linux. I have not tested the xmodmap in recent Linux distributions, but the Windows installer works fine in Windows 7.
